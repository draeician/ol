We will be adding a Implement a CLI switch to download and save a model's Modelfile.
---
Extend the "save Modelfile" feature to support saving for ALL models via -a/--all.

Add CLI flags to set the Ollama host/port, without breaking -h help. New flags: -H/--host (default "localhost") and -p/--port (default 11434). These override OLLAMA_HOST for the current command. Keep -h for help. Do NOT use -h for host.
---
Change -h from help to -host and make help --help -?
